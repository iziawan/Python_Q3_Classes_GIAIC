# **Type Conversion**       ==> Python`s interpreter automatically implement type conversion:
a, b = 1, 2.0
print(a + b)     # type conversion works here automatically, convert a to float because float is superior have extra information

# GIVES ERROR
# a, b = 1,""    
# sum = a + b
# print(sum)



# **Type Casting**  ==> casting means which we need to implement manually
